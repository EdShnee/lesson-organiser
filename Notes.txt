Program for helping keep track of piano lessons

For each lesson it should store a unique lesson key, the pupil, the date, the time and the fee
	Stored in a series of dictionaries - the key is the lesson code, the value is 	the name/date/length/fee etc.

	Each pupil should have a dictionary as well, with all their previous lesson keys stored in them.

Info to store about each pupil - unique pupil key, name, normal lesson length, normal lesson fee, as well as a record of all previous lessons
